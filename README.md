# Fractured Double

A JUCE-based audio plugin that creates unique doubling effects using granular synthesis techniques.

## Overview

Fractured Double is an audio effect that breaks incoming audio into small grains and creates two pitch-shifted copies with controlled randomization. This produces a "fractured" or broken-up doubling effect that adds texture and width to audio sources.

## Features

- **Granular Processing**: Breaks audio into 40ms grains with Hann windowing
- **Dual Pitch-Shifted Voices**: 
  - Ghost A: +1.2 semitones (slightly higher)
  - Ghost B: -1.2 semitones (slightly lower)
- **Controlled Randomization**:
  - Pitch Depth: 0-12 semitones of random pitch variation
  - Jitter: 0-100ms timing randomization to prevent mechanical repetition
  - Wet Mix: Blend between dry and processed signal
- **Real-time Processing**: Uses circular buffering for low-latency performance

## Technical Implementation

### Core Algorithm
- **Grain Size**: Fixed 40ms grains with 50% overlap
- **Windowing**: Hann window function for smooth grain transitions
- **Pitch Shifting**: Semitone-based pitch shifting using playback rate adjustment
- **Buffer Management**: 2-second circular buffer for grain scheduling
- **Randomization**: De-synchronized grain triggering to avoid periodic artifacts

### Audio Processing Chain
1. Input audio is written to a circular buffer
2. Grains are scheduled with randomized hop sizes (±30% variation)
3. Each grain spawns two pitch-shifted copies
4. Random pitch variation is applied within the specified depth range
5. Timing jitter is applied to grain read positions
6. Output is mixed with dry signal based on wet mix parameter

## Building the Project

### Requirements
- **JUCE Framework** (version 6.0 or later)
- **Visual Studio 2022** (Windows) or **Xcode** (macOS)
- **C++17** compatible compiler

### JUCE Modules Required
The project uses the following JUCE modules:
- `juce_audio_basics` - Core audio processing
- `juce_audio_devices` - Audio device handling
- `juce_audio_formats` - Audio file I/O
- `juce_audio_plugin_client` - Plugin wrapper functionality
- `juce_audio_processors` - Audio processor base classes
- `juce_audio_utils` - Audio utility classes
- `juce_core` - Core JUCE functionality
- `juce_data_structures` - Data structure utilities
- `juce_events` - Event handling system
- `juce_graphics` - Graphics and drawing
- `juce_gui_basics` - Basic GUI components
- `juce_gui_extra` - Extended GUI components

### Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhishekramakri/Fractured-Double.git
   cd Fractured-Double
   ```

2. **Open in Projucer**:
   - Launch Projucer
   - Open `Fractured Double/Fractured Double.jucer`
   - Configure your JUCE modules path in the project settings
   - Set your desired plugin formats (VST3, AU, AAX, etc.)

3. **Generate IDE project**:
   - Click "Save Project and Open in IDE"
   - This will generate platform-specific project files in the `Builds/` folder

4. **Build the plugin**:
   - **Windows**: Open the generated Visual Studio solution and build
   - **macOS**: Open the Xcode project and build
   - **Linux**: Use the generated Makefile

### Plugin Formats
The project can be built as:
- **VST3** - Industry standard plugin format
- **AU** - Audio Units (macOS only)
- **AAX** - Pro Tools format
- **Standalone** - Standalone application

## Usage

### Parameters
- **Pitch Depth** (0-12 semitones): Controls the range of random pitch variation applied to each grain
- **Jitter** (0-100ms): Adds timing randomization to prevent mechanical repetition
- **Wet Mix** (0-100%): Blends between the dry input signal and the processed output

### Typical Use Cases
- Adding width and texture to vocals
- Creating ambient pad textures
- Enhancing lead instruments with subtle doubling
- Sound design for film and game audio

## Development Notes

- The `Builds/` and `JuceLibraryCode/` folders are generated by Projucer and excluded from version control
- All audio processing happens in `PluginProcessor::processBlock()`
- The GUI uses JUCE's built-in slider components with rotary style
- Parameters are managed through JUCE's `AudioProcessorValueTreeState`
